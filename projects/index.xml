      <description>In this project, our goal was to create a point of interest rating system. Users would be able to add POIs, rate POIs, create lists of POIs and there would be a basic exploration mechanism. We used Model View Controller design pattern in this project separate the data layers from the transport layers from the views. We also utilized a client-server approach where the frontend website got its data from a backend database.</description>

      <description>This project was designed to be a tool for TAs to help manage a help queue for when students have questions during office hours or lab sections. In this project, we used a backend server to manage the lists and a frontend view to just display the data. The backend server was written in Express (JavaScript). The frontend was written in React. This was a project for HackISU, so the first iteration was a little rough around the edges, but it got smoothed out a bit later.</description>

      <description>Our project was an application designed for users who want a way to more easily keep track of how much time they work on their computer. The program is a timer that can either be manually turned on and off or it can be set up to automatically detect when a selected program is opened and keep track of time until it is closed. The overall component diagram of the project is included below.</description>
