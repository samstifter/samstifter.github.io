Our project was an application designed for users who want a way to more easily keep track of how much time they work on their computer. The program is a timer that can either be manually turned on and off or it can be set up to automatically detect when a selected program is opened and keep track of time until it is closed. The overall component diagram of the project is included below. The program used csv files as method to save the data. We went through a few iterations of the design until we landed on the one that could appropriately save and load data. We used the Model View Controller design pattern to help separate the data from the UI. The skills gained include Agile, Extreme Programming, MVC pattern, intro to git, collaboration, and JavaFX UI development.

## Overview
Our project was an application designed for users who want a way to more easily keep track of how much time they work on their computer. The program is a timer that can either be manually turned on and off or it can be set up to automatically detect when a selected program is opened and keep track of time until it is closed.

## Tools Used
Software needed to make this work:

- [Java 8](https://java.com/en/)
- JavaFX, included in the JDK

## What's Next
We took the summer off from this project. After letting it sit for a while, we plan to return to it during the 2018-19 school year. Some plans include moving from CSV data storage to either an embedded database or a client-server model. We are also looking to expand the application tracking and make it more robust.
