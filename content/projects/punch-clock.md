## Overview
Our project was an application designed for users who want a way to more easily keep track of how much time they work on their computer. The program is a timer that can either be manually turned on and off or it can be set up to automatically detect when a selected program is opened and keep track of time until it is closed.

## Tools Used
Software needed to make this work:

- [Java 8](https://java.com/en/)
- JavaFX, included in the JDK

## What's Next
We took the summer off from this project. After letting it sit for a while, we plan to return to it during the 2018-19 school year. Some plans include moving from CSV data storage to either an embedded database or a client-server model. We are also looking to expand the application tracking and make it more robust.
