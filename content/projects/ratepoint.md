In this project, our goal was to create a point of interest rating system. Users would be able to add POIs, rate POIs, create lists of POIs and there would be a basic exploration mechanism. We used Model View Controller design pattern in this project separate the data layers from the transport layers from the
views. We also utilized a client-server approach where the frontend website got its data from a backend database. In this project, I gained skills in the following: Spring (Java Web framework), React, Issue management with Gitlab, CI/CD with Gitlab, web development, API documentation, UML diagrams, advanced git usage.
