This project was designed to be a tool for TAs to help manage a help queue for when students have questions during office hours or lab sections. In this project, we used a backend server to manage the lists and a frontend view to just display the data. The backend server was written in Express (JavaScript). The frontend was written in React. This was a project for HackISU, so the first iteration was a little rough around the edges, but it got smoothed out a bit later. I gained the following skills: Server-side Javascript, server deployment and management, domain names, web hosting.
