Hi! I am a Software Engineering student at Iowa State University. I am in my third year and expect to graduate in May 2020. I am currently in my third semester as a Teaching Assistant in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department for CPR E 288 Embedded Systems: Introduction.

A selection of courses I have taken include: data structures, digital logic, software construction, user interfaces, databases, and computer organization. A full list with course codes can be found [here](/course-list/).

Outside of class, I enjoy getting outside. I am an Eagle Scout in the BSA and a Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow. I continue to stay active through service projects in the Order of the Arrow. I also worked as a Kayak Guide for two summers at Stone Harbor Wilderness Supply in Grand Marais, MN. I enjoy cycling in the warmer months, and downhill skiing in the winter months.
